How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could see all the changes made.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can check to see  where in the history things changed and understand the key info. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You will tend to be more careful when commiting changes. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Code often has multiple source files that work together. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show the commit log
	
	git diff will show the differences between revisions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We will have saved older working versions of things

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To host all my Udacity and App Academy coursework, and other of my learning and passion projects
